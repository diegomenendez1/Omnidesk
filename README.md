# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and provide your Firebase
credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

These values are required for the app to connect to Firebase.
