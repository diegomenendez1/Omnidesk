# Omnidesk

This project started in Firebase Studio but now runs as a regular Next.js
application. Firebase Studio is **not** required to develop or run it.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The main entry point is `src/app/page.tsx`.
